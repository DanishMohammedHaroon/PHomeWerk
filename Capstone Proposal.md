# Project Title
PHomeWerk (P for Physio, Home because it will be done at home or in a personal environment and Werk... because work is more fun and do-able when it does not sound like work!)... I will refer it to as PHW.

## Overview

Life is a loop, a routine, its dynamic is a sort of way where it takes feedback and adjust so we can maintain a certain format of living.
User Side: (a.k.a. the Physiotherapists)
PHW is about providing access to better feedback and patient care for the Physiotherapists. They can assign exercises to clients, set repspetitions and difficulty level of exercise.
Client Side: (a.k.a. the Patient)  
On the patient side it is to provide: accountability, tracking, remote access to exercises and a way to immediately notify their Physiotherapists if an exercise is not working for them, enabling the Physiotherapist to adjust the workout/regime according to the feedback... which can be dome after an in person visit, or even remotely.

### Problem Space

1. When covid hit we all lost acces to life's necessities, access to healthcare was one of them, in our community of St. John's, NL we have the bulk of our population either in the working age (15 - 65) with heavier emphasis on the later years, and we have a higher than average elderly population. For them (15- 65 age demographic) to be working optimally access to physical health and wellbeing is necessary and 

### User Profile

Who will use your app? How will they use it? Add any special considerations that your app must take into account.

### Features

List the functionality that your app will include. These can be written as user stories or descriptions with related details. Do not describe _how_ these features are implemented, only _what_ needs to be implemented.

## Implementation

### Tech Stack

List technologies that will be used in your app, including any libraries to save time or provide more functionality. Be sure to research any potential limitations.

### APIs

List any external sources of data that will be used in your app.

### Sitemap

List the pages of your app with brief descriptions. You can show this visually, or write it out.

### Mockups

Provide visuals of your app's screens. You can use pictures of hand-drawn sketches, or wireframing tools like Figma.

### Data

Describe your data and the relationships between the data points. You can show this visually using diagrams, or write it out. 

### Endpoints

List endpoints that your server will implement, including HTTP methods, parameters, and example responses.

## Roadmap

Scope your project as a sprint. Break down the tasks that will need to be completed and map out timeframes for implementation working back from the capstone due date.

## Future Implementations
Your project will be marked based on what you committed to in the above document. Here, you can list any additional features you may complete after the MVP of your application is built, or if you have extra time before the Capstone due date.
